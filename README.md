# Busy beaver Turing machine simulator

Object-oriented Turing machine simulator in C# that executes Busy Beaver Turing machines procedurally.
* Uses Ukkonen’s algorithm to recognize if a Turing machine is indefinitely executing.
* Produces bitmap representations of the movements of the Turing machine. 
* Uses REST API’s to upload results to social media such as Facebook.

This was originally my high school coursework submission.
As the program is rigid and cannot run without a local corresponding database, the program doesn't run out of the box and I will not be providing support for it. I will, instead, be rewriting the codebase in another repo.
